Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The secure version makes sure that paramters that are being sent are just strings and not any code that may try to get access to the database directly and get the information needed. The input is not being sanitsed in the insecure version. This can give access to data from the db directly.

It violates Integrity and confidentiality properties.
Maybe we can get the data ourselevs from the data and then compare the query paramters in the server rather than the DB.
